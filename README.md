🛤️ **My Journey into Coding**  
My interest in coding began in middle school and high school, where I remember building a Mario clone in 8th grade using Scratch. Initially, I majored in computer science because I enjoyed it in high school and was good at math, though I wasn’t particularly passionate about it. Eventually, I decided to drop it and pursue Global Studies, driven by a growing interest in the world, traveling, and global issues.  

In my junior year of college, I stumbled upon a FreeCodeCamp video on CS50, and it reignited my passion for coding. I decided to brush up on my previous knowledge, teach myself programming, and continue to grow and learn. I also added computer science as a double major. Since then, I’ve been learning how to code and finding ways to combine my two disciplines, like the Java migration map project.  

🌟 **Fun Facts**  
- I love watching soccer, and my favorite team is (sadly) Manchester United 👹.  
- I played Division 1 soccer at Virginia Tech for a short time.  
- I love video games, with Elden Ring and Rainbow Six Siege being two of my favorites.  
- Traveling is a passion of mine, and Colombia has been my favorite destination so far.  
- I enjoy photography, capturing moments through my lens whenever I can.  
- I just finished Squid Games, Kaiju No. 8, and Solo Leveling, and I’m currently watching Dan Da Dan.
